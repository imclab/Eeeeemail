## About

Eeeeemail will randomly select one email from your Gmail Sent Mail folder and send that to another eeeemailer. In exchange, you will receive a randomly selected email from that person. 

We remove all email addresses before forwarding the email. We’ll show you which email we’ve sent, but you can’t undo it. 

You’ll be sent to to Google to give us access to your Sent Mail folder.
